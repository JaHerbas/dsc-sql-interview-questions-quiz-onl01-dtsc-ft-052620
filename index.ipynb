    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, BLOB\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between these two is that the foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that references the primary key in different table, and the primary key is the unique identifier of a record in one table. \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically three types of relationship entities in an SQL database, these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tOne-to-One: when each record of one table is related to only one record of the other table (I donâ€™t remember if we saw this one in this section though, I read about it online)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tOne-to-Many or Many-to-One: this relationship exists when each record of one table can be related to one or more than one record of the other table. The Many-to-One relationship is a One-to-Many seeing on a different angle\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tMany-to-Many: this is when each record of the first table can be related to one or more than one record of the second table and a single record of the second tab  ne related to one or more than one record of the first table. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of JOINs but the ones that sqlite supports are JOIN, which is an INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JOIN is basically the part that is intercepted between both tables (area in common), and thee LEFT JOIN is the same with the difference that is also returns the records from the left table, so intercepted areas plus left table records\n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "The GROUP DATA function aggregates data by using aggregate functions such as COUNT, AVG, SUM, MAX and others. \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "The associative entities or JOIN tables are tables that sit between the other two tables of the many-to-many JOINs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of these entities is to store a record of the combination of the other two tables \n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
